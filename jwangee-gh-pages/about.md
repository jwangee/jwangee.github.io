<p>I am a first-year Ph.D student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at University of Southern California. I work in the Networked Systems Lab (<a href="https://enl.usc.edu">NSL</a>) with my adviser Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/usc.edu/ramesh/">Ramesh Govindan</a>. Before joining NSL, I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn">Peking University</a> where I built background knowledge in both hardware and software.</p>
<p>I am interested in computer networks research including Internet Measurement, Network Protocols and Data Center Networks. I am now working on designing diagnosis system which runs on servers in data centers and enables the owner to figure out the root cause of network failures for each of its consumers.</p>
